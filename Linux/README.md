# ManuvrLinux

A collection of shims for running ManuvrDrivers and CppPotpourri on top of Linux.

## Usage

Typically, this repo will be built and included as a library by the application.
Static builds are recommended, but that's an aesthetic opinion.

------------------------

### Dependencies

This class relies on [CppPotpourri](https://github.com/jspark311/CppPotpourri).

------------------------

### Building the examples

You will need to either clone CppPotpourri into `examples/lib/CppPotpourri`, or else symlink it there.
